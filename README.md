# Spring Boot

## Basic Concepts/ Skills
- 1. Spring Context -> Store Beans
  - Who create Bean? Before server start, "Spring Manager" manages bean cycle.
  - Bean cycle: @SpringBootApplication -> @ComponentScan, i.e., Find any class contain
      @Controller, @Service, @Configuration, @Repository
  - "Spring Manager" create objects for the above classes, put them into Spring Context (Beans)
  2. Get Beans from Context (Resolve Dependencies between beans)
  - @Autowired on Class Attribute (Field Injection)
    - "Spring Manager" resolve this dependency by finding an appropriate object fit into the 
    attribute type
  - @Autowired on Constructor (Constructor Injection)
  3. Flow
  - Controller Bean always @Autowired Service Bean
  - Service Bean always @Autowired Repository Bean
  - If "Spring Manager" cannot find any dependency, server start will fail.
  4. RESTful API (GET/POST/DELETE/PUT/PATCH)
  - GET: Without create, update, delete on resource
  - POST: Create resource ONLY
  - DELETE: Delete resource ONLY (by id, or other resource attribute)
  - PUT: Make sure target resource already exists (Find by id). Then replace the resource 
      by the new resource directly
  - PATCH: Make sure target resource already exists (Find by id). Then revise the target object
      attribute, but not replace the object.
  

## Spring Boot Project Development
- Create project by VSCode. Add dependencies for your scenario.
- After project creation, restart the VSCode.
- Check pom.xml and application.yml
- If you need add/remove dependency, restart VSCode
- Create controller folder
 - Inside the folder, create interface (XXXXOperation.java)
 - Create impl folder, create implementation for the interface
- Create service folder
 - Inside the folder, create interface (XXXXService.java)
 - Create impl folder, create implementation for the interface
- When Controller @Autowired Service, remember to use service interface, but not implementation class
- test "mvn clean install"
